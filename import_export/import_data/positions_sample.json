Gen. Kamala Harris is a veteran prosecutor, a skilled political leader and a promising politician who is sure to figure in California's future. Her opponent on the November ballot, Republican Ron Gold, is a private lawyer who has never held elected office and thus has no record of political achievement. Some endorsements are difficult; this one is not. Harris deserves to be reelected and to continue her work as the state's chief law enforcement officer.\r\n\r\nHarris served as district attorney of San Francisco before being elected state attorney general in 2010. Since then her tenure has been mixed. She has failed to step up on some important issues and has had notable accomplishments in other areas. She helped secure significant debt reduction for California homeowners in her battle with banks accused of improperly foreclosing on some properties. She has focused resources on combating human trafficking and recidivism, and has sought to reduce truancy, arguing persuasively that keeping children in school is a way of diverting them from crime. Rather than confining herself to the legal representation of the state and its agencies, she has, at least in some areas, helped guide a larger conversation about criminal justice.\r\n\r\nYet her record is by no means perfect. Harris was slow to join the extremely important discussion of Gov. Jerry Brown's realignment program, which is diverting many low-level offenders from state prisons to county jails and altering post-release supervision systems. Swifter engagement and clearer guidance from the state's top lawyer might have curtailed some of the misinformation that greeted that program. She has, however, entered the fray now.\r\n\r\nKamala Harris has failed to step up on some important issues and has had notable accomplishments in other areas.\r\n-  \r\nShe is also tactical and sometimes too cautious; consider her reluctance to tackle such thorny questions as marijuana legalization and the implications of California's teacher tenure rules for the quality of education. Both are divisive issues where taking a stand could alienate supporters.\r\n\r\nHarris is sometimes accused of excessive partisanship â€” some say she crafts ballot language on initiatives that favor her side of an argument â€” and there is no denying her ambition; a run for governor seems likely. But there's nothing wrong with ambition so long as it's constructively channeled, and Harris also has demonstrated that she is capable of putting her professional responsibility over her politics. Recently, her office appealed a Superior Court ruling that found California's death penalty unconstitutional. Although Harris opposes capital punishment, she concluded that she had a responsibility to defend the law (in this case, notably, a popular law).\r\n\r\nMany years ago, Ron Gold worked as a deputy attorney general. That experience provides him with some insight and ideas for realigning some of the attorney general's priorities â€” increasing its emphasis on fighting public corruption, for instance. But though he is a capable lawyer and a thoughtful candidate, his background does not compare with the incumbent's.\r\n\r\nHarris has generally performed well in her first term, and shows promise of performing better in her second. She deserves the opportunity to do so.","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos8","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org8","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand12","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://www.dailynews.com/opinion/20141003/re-elect-kamala-harris-as-attorney-general-x2014-but-demand-more-endorsement","statement_text":"Some politicians have to work a little harder to carry the burden of great potential. Such is the case for Kamala Harris as she plans a second term as Californiaâ€™s attorney general.\r\n\r\nAlthough Harris receives the Los Angeles News Groupâ€™s endorsement for the Nov. 4 election, this has a lot to do with the sparse credentials of opponent Ronald Gold. The editorial board would like to see Harris be more aggressive in the job she holds and live down the suspicion that her real priority is to plot a safe path to higher office.\r\n\r\nHer future is the subject of wide speculation. It is generally assumed Harris will run for governor in 2018. But she has been called a potential U.S. Supreme Court nominee. She was mentioned as a potential U.S. attorney general after Eric Holder announced his plan to resign; she said she is not interested. And, oddly, at one point this year a couple of British bookmakers posted odds against her winning the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, as if that were even a remote possibility.\r\n\r\nIf all of this didnâ€™t raise the risk of distraction, Harris found herself in national headlines last year because of President Barack Obamaâ€™s ill-considered remark, at a fundraiser in San Francisco, that she â€œhappens to be, by far, the best-looking attorney general in the country.â€\r\n\r\nLittle of this talk about her future and the elements of her appeal is her fault. Itâ€™s flattering stuff, and itâ€™s one of the reasons people pay attention to what she does and says. But it can cause problems if she believes her own hype and lets thoughts of the future get in the way of completing the tasks at hand.\r\n\r\nShe did not allay that concern when she spoke with the editorial board in a meeting Harris requested to tout state legislation she was proposing to curb school truancy.\r\n\r\nHarris said the issue of truancy had been a passion of hers since she was San Franciscoâ€™s district attorney, because it puts kids on the path to failure and costs schools more than $1â€‰billion a year in federal funding based on attendance. Two of Harrisâ€™ bills would have required the state Department of Education and local school boards to collect data on truancy and absenteeism in order to shape anti-truancy policies. But when she was asked what the data from a similar effort in San Francisco had shown, she seemed not to know or have thought about it.\r\n\r\nGov. Jerry Brown wound up vetoing those bills, saying the collection of data for analysis by state authorities wouldnâ€™t get to the root of the issue. Brown did sign two other Harris-backed bills related to truancy.\r\n\r\nIt was hard not to conclude that Harris chose truancy as an election-season focus because itâ€™s an issue without much political risk.\r\n\r\nThat caution extends to her unwillingness to offer clear plans on big California issues such as legislative corruption, prison overcrowding, capital punishment and marijuana legalization. Her officeâ€™s misleading wording of a pension-reform measure cost it a shot at the state ballot, pleasing Democratsâ€™ union backers.","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos9","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org9","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand12","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/election-endorsements/article2607527.html","statement_text":"Attorney General Kamala Harris almost certainly will lead Californiaâ€™s Department of Justice for the next four years, appropriately so.\r\n\r\nThe weakened California Republican Party failed to recruit a candidate to seriously challenge Harrisâ€™ re-election to the most important statewide office that is not governor or Supreme Court justice.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, The Sacramento Beeâ€™s editorial board endorsed Harrisâ€™ opponent, former Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, a Republican. But we never doubted that Harris was energetic and forward-thinking.\r\n\r\nIn her first four years as attorney general, Harris has focused on consumer issues, suing for-profit Corinthian Colleges for misleading students, and wresting tens of billions of dollars for the state from settlements of nationwide lawsuits by the federal government to assist individuals and regions affected by the housing crisis.\r\n\r\nShe has supported gun control, helped implement Gov. Jerry Brownâ€™s criminal justice realignment, tried to bring attention to human trafficking, and highlighted threats posed by transnational organized crime.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, she refused to appeal the court decision overturning Proposition 8, the 2008 initiative that sought to ban same-sex marriage. It was an important political and moral stand, and one popular with her Democratic base.\r\n\r\nBut the stateâ€™s top lawyer has displayed an unwillingness to take risks. She could be more aggressive on public corruption cases, though her handlers might worry that would cause friction with fellow Democratic politicians. She should raise privacy issues, though that might upset Silicon Valley interests.\r\n\r\nShe has ducked taking stands on Internet gambling, which is supported by wealthy casino tribes, and marijuana legalization, which is increasingly popular among voters but also would have public safety implications.\r\n\r\nVoters deserve to know her views on Vergara v. California, which could become a landmark challenge to the stateâ€™s teacher tenure rules. Harris says she is precluded from discussing the case because her office represents the state.\r\n\r\nHer silence conveniently ensures she will not run afoul of the powerful California Teachers Association, which defends tenure rules, or wealthy school reform advocates who seek to weaken tenure rules.\r\n\r\nHarrisâ€™ opponent, Los Angeles attorney Ron Gold, has little campaign money or organization.\r\n\r\nHe supports marijuana legalization, but does not appear to have thought through basic details. When he visited The Beeâ€™s editorial board, Gold could not articulate a clear view about whether marijuana purveyors should be permitted to advertise their product if it is legalized, and what impact widespread advertising might have on children.\r\n\r\nThe GOPâ€™s failure to recruit a worthy opponent to Harris is surprising, given that George Deukmejian, who became governor, and Dan Lungren, a former congressman, have held the post in recent decades, and Cooley nearly won four years ago.\r\n\r\nThe attorney general is entrusted with an office that has a great tradition, and long has attracted talented lawyers who are more interested in a mission than money. Giants have held the post, including Earl Warren, who became chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; Pat Brown, who became governor; and Stanley Mosk, who served more than three decades on the California Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nHarris could become a solid attorney general. But deputies attorney general donâ€™t see her as particularly committed to the work of the office. She rarely is sighted in Sacramento, where much of the Department of Justice is located.\r\n\r\nShe spends much of her time in Los Angeles and San Francisco, smart politics for an aspiring governor or U.S. senator. She must know that how she handles her current job will help determine whether she wins another job.\r\n\r\nHarris has had months to fill one of the most important positions, chief assistant attorney general for the criminal division, and took months to fill the head of the civil division earlier in her tenure.\r\n\r\nHarrisâ€™ re-election is as close to a fait accompli as there is in politics. She has done nothing that would warrant denying her a second term. In that second term, she should focus on running the office and taking some stands, even if that means crossing potential supporters.\r\n\r\nRead more here: http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/election-endorsements/article2607527.html#storylink=cpy","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos10","organization_id_we_vote":"","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand11","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"NO_STANCE","more_info_url":null,"statement_text":null,"statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos11","organization_id_we_vote":"","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand24","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":null,"statement_text":null,"statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos12","organization_id_we_vote":"","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand12","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":null,"statement_text":null,"statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos3","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org6","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand24","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://votealix.com/2014/11/01/big-ol-voter-guide-for-san-francisco-november-2014/","statement_text":"The Assessor-Recorder assesses property values for tax purposes and brings in about one-third of the cityâ€™s General Fund revenue.

The two leading candidates are both named David, they both went to Harvard, they both serve on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. They have an almost identical voting record. They both also serve on the board of the San Francisco Democratic Party with me, and so I know them both well, and consider them both friends. If you voted in the June election, youâ€™ve already made your choice between David Campos and David Chiu. Because of a quirk in Californiaâ€™s top two voting system, these two candidates are up against each other one more time.\r\n\r\nBoth Davids would be progressive leaders in the state legislature. But I believe that Chiu will be a more effective advocate for legislation that reflects our San Francisco values. As the President of the Board of Supervisors, Chiu has proven to be adept at shepherding legislation and forging compromise, which skills are especially necessary in a state legislature populated with folks from all over this strange state. (For example, thereâ€™s THIS GUY. Yeah. Whoah.)\r\n\r\nCampos is openly gay, like the two men who most recently held this seat, Tom Ammiano and Mark Leno. Campos and his supporters claim that the seat should be held by someone who identifies as LGBT. I disagree â€“ no seat in the legislature should be a â€œgay seatâ€ or an â€œAsian seatâ€ or â€œfixie ridingtech broâ€ seat. The candidate who can best represent all of the districtâ€™s constituencies should win. Period.\r\n\r\nIf you know me, you know that I have always been an advocate for getting more women (and especially mothers!) in public office. Women are generally underrepresented in leadership positions, and itâ€™s important to include womenâ€™s voices in the decisions that affect all of us. But to propose that a specific seat is a â€œwomanâ€™s seatâ€ would be ludicrous. There certainly arenâ€™t enough LGBT folks in the state legislature (there are 8 including Ammiano, which is 7% of the total members), however, we have made considerable progress on this front in recent years. The current Assembly Speaker is an out lesbian and the previous Speaker was a gay man.\r\n\r\nI do think itâ€™s really gross that some well-funded haters have been sending out mail trying to connect Campos with Ross Mirkarimiâ€™s domestic violence issues. Specifically, they claim that Camposâ€™ vote against removing Ross from office makes him unqualified to serve in the Assembly. Regardless of your feelings about Mirkarimi, this argument is laughable.

Attorney General Kamala Harris came into office in 2011 with a few distinct priorities, including the pursuit of transnational gangs, the epidemic of school truancy, the recidivism rate and the foreclosure crisis.\r\nHer choices have been solid, her follow-up has been intense and the results have been impressive. The former San Francisco district attorney has earned a second term as chief state law enforcement officer.\r\nHer focus on truancy should ring familiar to those who followed her work in San Francisco, where she once threatened to prosecute parents whose children habitually miss school. Harris rightly noted, â€œThis seemingly simple issue is connected to a lot of big issues.â€ She has been pushing legislation that would closely track student attendance and hold districts accountable for high truancy rates.\r\nHer highest-profile accomplishment came from her role in helping California get $20 billion from five major banks in connection with the foreclosure crisis.\r\nHer opponent, Republican Ron Gold, stunned the political world in June by finishing ahead of ex-legislator Phil Wyman. Gold, whose previous venture into politics was a sixth-place finish for the Calabasas City Council (Los Angeles County), has an engaging style and iconoclastic agenda. Unlike Harris, he supports capital punishment, marijuana legalization and a Los Angeles judgeâ€™s ruling that the stateâ€™s rigid system of teacher tenure undermines the right of low-income students to a quality education (Harris has refused to express her personal opinion on the latter).\r\nOne of his criticisms of Harris is that her gubernatorial ambitions might cause her to be too risk-averse.

His pitch sometimes gets a bit jargony, but his idealism about government and politics can be infectious.\r\nHis opponent, state Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Los Angeles, would bring a more traditional background to the job. Padilla has spent more than two decades in politics, starting with his 2001 election to the Los Angeles City Council at age 26. He was elected to the state Senate in 2006, and proved himself one of its more effective members, authoring more than 70 bills that have been signed into law, including some medium-scale election reforms and the statewide ban on plastic bags.\r\nThe question before voters, however, is which candidate is the best fit for this office.\r\nThe conventional wisdom in modern politics is that Democrats will do almost anything to to expand the voting pool â€” given their advantage with casual voters â€” and Republicans will do almost anything to suppress it. Examples have included GOP efforts to require voter IDs, limit voting times and locations, purge the rolls, and preserve barriers to easy registration.\r\nPeterson breaks from the party line on voter participation. He is committed to increasing it. He said voter-ID laws were â€œjust bad policyâ€ because â€œthe research is explicitâ€ that fraud is not a problem at the polling place. He also wants to aggressively increase registration and turnout â€” and, unlike many of his party brethren, does not believe it will necessarily benefit Democrats.\r\nâ€œWhen this (Republican) party is at its best, thereâ€™s a populist theme undergirding it,â€ he said.\r\nOne of our concerns with Padilla is his mixed record on reform, most notably his opposition to the landmark initiative that put an independent commission â€” rather than politicians â€” in charge of drawing boundaries for legislative districts. There is also the question of whether he might leap for a higher-profile office.\r\nWith Peterson, there is no doubting that this is the one seat he wants. He views the office as a â€œ6- to 8-year recovery projectâ€ after the disappointing tenure of Debra Bowen, whose attention was diverted by both a 2011 race for a Southern California congressional seat and a serious bout with depression. Her elected predecessor, Kevin Shelley, resigned amid scandal in 2005.\r\nIt would be refreshing to bring in a chief elections officer with credentials and enthusiasm that are perfectly tailored to this job. Peterson is our choice.","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos33","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org14","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand7","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Chronicle-recommends-Chiang-for-state-treasurer-5804629.php","statement_text":"John Chiang has demonstrated his fiscal savvy and toughness for nearly eight years in the state controllerâ€™s office. He would be a lock for re-election if not for term limits.\r\nSo Chiang has set his sights on the state treasurerâ€™s office, where his skill set and attention to principle would make him a logical successor to Bill Lockyer. In fact, the duties and attributes of the two state offices overlap to the point that a good case could be made for combining them â€” but weâ€™ll save that argument for another day. Each is on the ballot in November.\r\nChiang proved a steady hand in managing the stateâ€™s cash flow through the worst economic straits since the Great Depression. In the depths of the crisis, Chiang kept the pressure on the Legislature and then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to produce credible solutions to shortfalls that exceeded $20 billion.\r\nChiang didnâ€™t win any friends in 2009 when he issued hundreds of millions of dollars in IOUs to ration the stateâ€™s cash supply â€” but it was necessary. He generated even more frustration with the Capitolâ€™s Democratic majority in 2011 when he withheld legislatorsâ€™ paychecks (as required by a voter initiative) when they tried to push through a budget that was not truly balanced.\r\nThe controller also showed fearlessness in taking on the life insurance industry, joining a nationwide probe that forced companies that were delaying or denying payouts to finally distribute more than $200 million to Californians.\r\nAlso, controller audits by Chiangâ€™s department have identified nearly $8.5 billion in misspent funds, unlawful taxes and other abuses elsewhere in state government.\r\nGreg Conlon, the Republican running for this open seat, has touted his experience as a certified public accountant and his commitment to reducing corporate taxes to keep jobs in California. His tax-cutting plans would be a long shot, at best, in the Legislature. Conlon was defeated by Phil Angelides in the 2002 treasurerâ€™s race, and later ran for U.S. Congress and the state Assembly.\r\nJohn Chiangâ€™s track record has demonstrated his ability to navigate the politics as well as the spreadsheets to defend the public interest.

It's a situation that should alert voters of the importance of the statewide office of controller with duties to audit spending, oversee budget figures and improve badly imbalanced public pension pools.\r\nAmong three capable and experienced candidates, Betty Yee has the sharpest credentials to carry through on these tasks. Yee has worked in state finances for three decades and is an elected member of the Board of Equalization, which hears tax disputes. Her independence and knowledge make her our choice to succeed John Chiang, the termed-out incumbent now running for treasurer.\r\nThe other candidates are credible alternatives. Assembly Speaker John PÃ©rez, a Los Angeles Democrat, was a major voice in state financial decisions over the past five years, cobbling together yearly budgets that called for deep cuts. Because of term limits, he's due to leave the Legislature and views the controller's post as a position where he can tap his experience on financial questions.\r\nThe third office seeker is Ashley Swearengin, the Republican mayor of Fresno. She's credited with salvaging the city's finances during the recession and has won election twice as leader of the state's fifth-largest city. She's drawn instant attention for placing first in an early season poll despite a shoestring campaign budget, giving the GOP hope that it can win statewide for the first time in years.\r\nOf the three, Yee has put out the most detailed and comprehensive agenda. She favors top-to-bottom tax reform, a challenge given Sacramento's reluctance to enter a political mine field.\r\nHer plan doesn't play to interest groups or political fears: She believes the tax burden should be broadened among taxpayers, not tilted toward wildly-swinging capital gains paid by the wealthy. That change would even out the surges and drops in collections that can cripple long-term budget-making.\r\nOn pensions, Yee believes all sides - government employers, unions and workers - will need to negotiate changes to revive two giant state pension plans for teachers and other state workers facing tens of billions in future retirement bills. It's a peril that Sacramento must address to protect both retirees and taxpayers.\r\nAmong the 80-plus commissions that include a seat for the controller is the State Lands Commission, which decides on development plans ranging from San Francisco's waterfront to coastal beaches. Yee has the independent outlook to make the right calls.\r\nIn a trio of solid choices, Yee gets the edge with her impressive knowledge and commitment to reform and fiscal prudence.","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos35","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org14","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand14","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Chronicle-recommends-re-electing-Insurance-5812879.php","statement_text":"Insurance bills for cars, homes and other coverage are among the biggest expenses a California resident faces. Thatâ€™s why consumers need a vigilant and tough-minded advocate like Dave Jones as state insurance commissioner.\r\nJones, a Democrat, and his rival, Republican state Sen. Ted Gaines, represent nearly polar opposites in their views of the powerful Sacramento office. Jones, a four-year incumbent looking for a second term, favors vigorous enforcement, mainly by approving or rejecting most insurance premium increases sought by companies.\r\nChallenger Gaines, who runs a family insurance agency in Roseville, Placer County, thinks the office has become too powerful. He believes Jones has chased companies out of California, chilling competition and harming innovation.\r\nA key example of the difference between the two candidates is Prop. 103, the initiative approved by voters in 1988. The measure gave the commissioner the power to review rates for driversâ€™ insurance, which is required for anyone who gets behind the wheel.\r\nJones is an enthusiastic supporter and has used his official hammer to push down costs in a car-crazy state, saving drivers billions. Gaines has his doubts, and believes prices can be kept low through more vigorous competition.\r\nItâ€™s a halfhearted and industry-friendly stance that undercuts one of the most effective tools the commissioner has. Voters who approved the auto insurance measure a generation ago did so because the market had failed to deliver reasonably priced policies. Thereâ€™s a role for informed review of premiums with a process that can protect consumers from being gouged, a stance that Jones has taken in his first term.\r\nThe race features an intriguing sideshow that is drawing in interest groups amid the publicâ€™s uncertainty about the federal Affordable Care Act. Jones has allied himself with trial lawyers behind Prop. 45, which would give give the commissionerâ€™s office additional power to control health coverage rates now beyond his reach. That measure, which this editorial page opposes, would add unneeded complications to the rollout of Californiaâ€™s adaptation of the ACA.\r\nGaines has cited Jonesâ€™ role in this separate dispute. But itâ€™s not a good enough reason to dismiss Jonesâ€™ track record as an effective public watchdog.\r\nFor nervous California homeowners, thereâ€™s an issue going nearly unmentioned in the race: earthquake coverage. Only 10 percent of the state has purchased coverage, which is costly and comes with a high deductible. Neither candidate has come up with an answer to protecting homeowners against severe damage such as that suffered in the Napa tremor in August.\r\nInsurance policy may not make for a riveting campaign. Itâ€™s especially true for next monthâ€™s ballot, which may feature one of the lowest turnouts on record. But itâ€™s no exaggeration to say that this office has an impact on Californiansâ€™ pocketbooks and sense of security.\r\nThe two candidates offer a clear choice in their approach to the office. Jones has both the experience and judgment to protect consumers. He deserves re-election.","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos36","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org14","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand16","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Chronicle-recommends-Governor-other-key-offices-5783646.php","statement_text":"The reason we endorsed challenger Marshall Tuck over a fellow Democrat, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson, was our confidence that Tuck would be more willing to challenge the status quo where it intruded on studentsâ€™ interest.\r\nOur assessment was corroborated in the reaction of the two to a Los Angeles judgeâ€™s finding that Californiaâ€™s unduly rigid rules on teacher tenure and seniority violated the right of low-income and minority students to a quality education.

Key projects that would make it easier to cast a ballot or track political campaign disclosures have been delayed, and there's been little urgency or advocacy from the outgoing incumbent, Debra Bowen, on how to better educate and engage voters, who are increasingly opting out of their civic duty.\r\n\r\nThe secretary of state, who is in effect the state's chief elections officer, should be more than a caretaker of the status quo. The job requires vision and a determination to make California a leader in voter turnout and technology, political transparency and civic engagement. Of the candidates running, Pete Peterson is the best choice for the post. He has innovative yet practical ideas to register voters, make ballot information more accessible and help make election day more convenient for busy Californians. He also brings a welcome focus on making the state's business registration system, which still relies on paper filings, more user-friendly. And he possesses an almost evangelical passion for public participation in the government, which is exactly what the office needs.\r\n\r\nAs a Republican, Peterson faces an uphill battle in a state that has not elected a member of the GOP to statewide office since 2006. But Californians should look beyond party affiliation in this race. Peterson views the job as nonpartisan, and his resume backs that up. As executive director of Pepperdine University's Davenport Institute for Public Engagement and Civic Leadership, he's spent the last several years training government officials on how to use technology to communicate with the public and how to get citizens to participate in civic decision-making. The secretary of state's office, which has a website straight out of the 1990s, could use his expertise.\r\n\r\nHis opponent, state Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Pacoima), is a smart and respected legislator. As part of his campaign, he has met with most county election officers around the state, which is important because the locals actually run most elections while the secretary of state oversees state and federal elections. One of the criticisms of Bowen, who is termed out, is that she hasn't worked well with county officials and has missed opportunities to develop voter registration campaigns and try out new voting equipment. We have concerns, however, that Padilla views the job merely as a steppingstone to higher office.\r\n\r\nCalifornia needs a chief elections officer who is fully committed to the difficult work of modernizing the state's election system, creating transparent political campaigns and advocating for the needs of voters. Peterson should be the next secretary of state.","statement_html":null},{"id_we_vote":"wv01pos37","organization_id_we_vote":"wv01org14","candidate_campaign_id_we_vote":"wv01cand23","measure_campaign_id_we_vote":"","date_entered":null,"election_id":null,"stance":"SUPPORT","more_info_url":"http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Hard-work-civil-style-qualifies-Chiu-for-Assembly-5419148.php","statement_text":"A civil manner and workhorse appetite for problem solving qualify Board of Supervisors President David Chiu for the state Assembly. Chiu is the clear choice over another San Francisco supervisor, David Campos.\r\nSince taking leadership of the board in 2009, Chiu has helped dial down the personal rancor and policy triviality that kept Fox News and comedians stocked with material but distracted from the job at hand. He's also proved a productive legislator with interests spanning city finances, housing, and personnel.\r\nFirst elected as a progressive, Chiu has proved willing to move to the center on various critical issues. He backed the Twitter tax break, which is rejuvenating a seedy stretch of Market Street, and opposed re-instating Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi after his conviction in a domestic violence case. On housing, Chiu has worked to rein in short-stay vacation rentals and pushed through changes to accommodate in-law apartments.\r\nCampos has been more ideologically rigid, which may play well with his far-left base in San Francisco, but is likely to make him a back-bencher even in a Democrat-controlled Assembly.\r\nThe campaign is taking a rough turn. Campos claimed in an hour-long debate before The Chronicle editorial board that Chiu has met with lobbyists more than twice as much as the next most-visited supervisor . But listening to others' views, and trying to build consensus and workability into legislation, is hardly a political crime - especially for a board president.\r\nCampos has tried to capitalize on anxieties and resentments about San Francisco's rich-poor divide. \"A tale of two cities\" is one of his themes.
